# Master Thesis

Through ferromagnetic resonance excitation, a long-range spin triplet supercurrent can flow through a ferromagnetic barrier, according to the theoretical prediction of Hikino et al. For electronic transport measurements through a superconductor-ferromagnet-superconductor contact, the dimension, such as the thickness, of the ferromagnet is crucial. Therefore, Co films as thin as $3\,$nm were prepared by electron beam evaporation with a co-planar wave guide on top. Transmission measurements were performed at cryogenic temperatures using an in-plane magnet and a broadband vector network analyzer.
A quantitative correlation between ferromagnetic resonance frequency and applied magnetic field could be established.

## Technical Note

I made a special emphasis on the design. I used the Universit√§t Konstanz Corporate Design. In addition to the official "seeblau", I used a magenta color for emphasis. I got the rgb values by switching the "seeblau" rgb values.

For writing I used overleaf.com. Back then I didn't know how to use git. Never to old to know, never told to grow.
